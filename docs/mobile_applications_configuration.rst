Mobile application configuration guide
======================================

Mobile apps need to be re-compiled with the correct server's IP address
for it to be functional.

To do so:

-  Open Android Studio

-  Open the mobile app project (available
   `here <https://github.com/openimis/master-version>`__)

-  Locate the file calledÂ General.java in the project explorer.

-  Edit the file by replacing the server's IP address or server name,
   and save.

-  Build the app via the tools menu

-  The new .apk file is now available in the release folder indication
   by Android Studio.
